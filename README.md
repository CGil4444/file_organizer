# file_organizer
File Organizer is a Python program designed to help you tidy up and organize your cluttered directories effortlessly.<br>
With this tool, you can quickly sort your files based on their extensions, and move them into dedicated folders, making it easier to locate and manage your documents, media, code, and other file types!<br><br>
This program supports a variety of file categories, including videos, images, documents, audio files, and code. It is very customizable, allowing you to modify the file categories to suit your own needs.

# Key Features
Automatic Categorization: The program automatically categorizes files into folders based on their extensions.<br>
Customizable Categories: You can easily customize the supported file categories to fit your needs!<br>
Fallback "Other" Folder: Any files that do not match the specified extensions will be moved to an "Other" folder.

# Usage
Run the program and provide it with the absolute path of your desired directory to organize:<br>
example: C:\Users\myuser\Downloads

# Supported File categories/extensions:
This program supports the most common file extensions, such as:

Videos: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .webm, and many more!<br>
Images: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp and many more!<br>
Documents: .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx, .txt, and many more!<br>
Audio: .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .aac, and many more!<br>
Code: .exe, .java, .py, .cpp, .dll, and many more!<br>

# Why
I originally made this for myself because my Downloads folder was an absolute hell to navigate, and I did not want to spend HOURS organizing files.<br>
Then I remembered I study computer science so...<br>
Anyway, feel free to customize this script to fit your needs, and I hope it helps you have a clutter-free workspace!<br>
